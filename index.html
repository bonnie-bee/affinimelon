            <h1>Chillin' as an AffiniMelon</h1>
            <p>You're a cool melon floating Town Lake on your paddleboard, just trying to have a chill day off.
                Unfortunately, work distractions keep showing up and harshing your mellow.
                It's a good thing you brought all those snacks to put you back in that relaxed state of mind.
                Hopefully none of them fall in the lake... nobody likes&nbsp;soggy&nbsp;snacks.</p>
            <h2>Object Of The Game</h2>
            <!-- <p>Keep chill and save the work for tomorrow when you're back on&nbsp;the&nbsp;clock!</p> -->
            <p>Use your arrow keys to paddle from side to side and collect snacks while
                trying to avoid work notifications.</p>
